**Who:** Developers, coders, and information specialists from the UC (including CDL) who work on the technical aspects of library projects, are interested in doing so, or otherwise are excited about collaborating with the CDL on development of services and infrastructure.

<br>

**What:** Two days of collaboration, sharing, hacking, and brainstorming, with a focus on data curation centric projects for the UC. Based on the unconference model (for an example, see [THATCamp](http://thatcamp.org/)).

<br>

**Why:** Collaboration, fun, insights, and improvements to UC services.

<br>
 
**When and Where:** August 27-28, 2014 in Oakland, CA. We will start at 11 am on Aug 27 and end by 3 pm on Aug 28 to minimize the need for lodging. More logistics here (to be revised as updates occur).
